This is DODGE THE VIRUS! It's a game where you travel between different funky websites in order to reach the final boss, THE DRAGON. The game is full of dangerous VIRUSES that you need to avoid. Being a victim of a virus breaks the game you need to restart to continue.

This was my first project at Hyper Island, where we got introduced to HTML, CSS & Javascript and our task was just to use those languages in our project. I really wanted to try out as many features within vanilla CSS/JS as possible and figured the best way was to create a whole bunch of different websites, with different features and functions then bring it all together in a sort of "game", where you navigate those websites.

All the pages including their CSS & JS are loaded dynamically through objects and most of the textures are hand drawn by me.
You can find each website in their own folders, with their own HTML, CSS and JS files. The "main" folder is where all the content is loaded dynamically.
