                But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure <br/>
                and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the<br/>
                system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth,<br/>
                the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids<br/>
                pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know<br/>
                how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely<br/>
                painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain<br/>
                pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances<br/>
                occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a<br/>
                trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise,<br/>
                except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault<br/>
                with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences,<br/>
                or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?
